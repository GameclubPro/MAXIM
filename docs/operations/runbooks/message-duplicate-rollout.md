# Message Duplicate Rollout

## Scope

Message-v1 extends duplicate checks to nonempty short text, visible forwards and attachment
captions. The registered message service owns duplicate admission in every runtime mode;
OFF/shadow never fall back to the retired rolling text filter. Full mode applies
the chat's configured explanation/WARN/MUTE/BAN ladder, per author and chat. Disabled reactions,
mute duration, allowed repeats and comparison windows are preserved. Missing, expired or invalid
runtime authority cannot authorize new actions. Fleet-wide rollout is an explicit product
operation, never a smoke test; live test mutations remain limited to the designated test entities.

Strict message-duplicate bindings use their own guarded delete-intent execution path, independent
of `MODERATION_DELETE_INTENT_MODE` and its legacy canary IDs. Admission, persisted recovery and
final dispatch must agree on this distinction. Do not widen the base delete rollout to enable
message duplicates: that would also promote unrelated historical moderation work.

`duplicateCompareMode=MESSAGE` compares text, navigation/actions and independently verified
non-photo media. Complete photo messages use the explicit IMAGE path: exact canonical image
sets, independent of captions, with administrator-selected SAME_AUTHOR or CHAT scope and the
same configured reaction ladder. CHAT counts escalation per author, never across participants.
`TEXT` compares text/captions and navigation/actions without media. Known media
without a retrievable original remain unverified in MESSAGE mode; filenames, sizes, previews,
platform IDs and download URLs are not equality evidence. Unsupported attachments and split
albums are skipped when the whole message cannot be verified. Complete attachment arrays are
one logical occurrence. Full mode v3 IMAGE bindings carry imageScope and exact media/source
proof. Old message bindings with photos are rejected; they cannot acquire the new policy.
The separate perceptual/photo-only filter is retired, its authority is permanently OFF and its
queue consumer only abandons old ordering entries. Never infer equality from media IDs or
bypass content verification. Legacy storage fields remain for rollback-safe schema compatibility.

## Fixed Publication Windows

`dup:window:v1:<chat-hash>:v2:` stores a fixed window per verified fingerprint, anchored to an accepted original's
MAX `Message.timestamp`. Deleted/rejected attempts never become originals or extend the window.
A newly accepted publication after expiry starts a new window. Configured allowed copies and
qualified violations are counted separately; immunity is checked before reserving a reaction stage.
Each message can reserve only one stage, and delivery retries recover that same stage, including
after a confirmed deletion. The final guard still rechecks authority before each action.

Cosmetic edits preserve publication time; an observed material edit starts the clock for its new
content at the edit timestamp, preventing old posts from bypassing matching. Media verification
preserves that introduction time when promoting pending content. Returning an original to a prior
text never revives its earlier revision's evidence. Changed content, conflicting edits with identical
update timestamps and removal events revoke evidence before moderation's early returns. The final
guard also reads the exact original from MAX, so missing removal webhooks cannot authorize deletion
against an absent original. An unavailable MAX lookup retries; it never proves absence.
Manual release advances a per-author Redis cutoff in constant time, fencing prior observations,
bindings and delayed media without deleting another author's shared IMAGE original. Existing
manual-release grace remains in effect.

Each atomic history operation examines at most 16 fingerprints; records and counters expire after
the bounded history retention. Lifecycle tombstones and reset cutoffs cover the maximum supported
window. This logic does not change burst, quota or other rolling counters. The new settings digest
and required original proof reject old queued evidence; no bulk Redis purge is needed.
A deployment changing the digest starts fresh duplicate history.

V3 bindings include lifecycle revisions for both messages, a stable `originalId`, explicit scope,
settings policy revision and bounded authorization. Caption edits and one independently verified
locator refresh preserve the occurrence. An intermediate material version, conflicting timestamp,
incomplete content or lost state never restores an old binding. A fresh MAX read can revoke stale
evidence but cannot manufacture a publication or introduction timestamp.

Migration `20260930180000_add_duplicate_policy_revisions` adds server-owned
`duplicatePolicyRevision` and `duplicateHistoryRevision` with constant-zero defaults. Its row
trigger covers every writer, including private controls and bulk settings copies. Inserts start
at zero; updates cannot choose or rewind either revision. Effective matching, schedule, comparison
window or allowed-repeat changes advance both revisions; reaction-only changes advance action
authority while preserving history. The first enabled reaction selects the effective interval and
threshold, and the allowed-repeat clamp includes the explanation stage and enabled reaction count.
Inactive intervals/thresholds, ignored preset options, unrelated UI fields and retired photo
toggle/preset writes do not advance revisions. Returning changed settings to earlier values still
advances the revision, so old bindings cannot regain authority. DAILY ignores saved interval
durations; INTERVAL ignores saved daily boundaries/timezone. The additive DDL has bounded lock and
statement timeouts and performs no history backfill or index build.

Both API rollback paths require the v3 lifecycle/action-permit reader and this revision trigger.
The former current-content-only guard is insufficient for pending v3 decisions, including after
runtime authority has been disabled. Keep every API role on a compatible exact image before
releasing the deployment queue fence.

## Daily Time Periods

`duplicateWindowMode` defaults to `INTERVAL`, preserving existing behavior. `DAILY` compares only
content published within the same daily `[start, end)` period in `duplicateTimezone`. The start
is included, the end is excluded; an end earlier than the start belongs to the following calendar
day. Equal times are rejected. Outside the period, duplicates are allowed. Each new period starts
with a new original and independent allowance/qualified-violation counts; stored interval hours
are retained when switching modes.

Admission, media candidate keys, history and final action guards share the same period. The original
expires at its end, and delayed jobs/intents cannot cross that boundary or inherit another day's
authority. Settings and timezone changes invalidate pending evidence. Unchanged edits of yesterday's
messages never seed today's history. Daily manual-release grace is limited to the current period.
Time boundaries use calendar days. On DST fallback the earliest start and latest end form one
continuous period; nonexistent spring times advance by the gap, and a collapsed period is skipped.

Migration `20260929120000_add_duplicate_daily_window` adds four columns with static defaults and
bounded DDL timeouts. Existing rows remain in interval mode. Older settings clients preserve omitted
schedule fields; section apply includes both the schedule and comparison mode. No rows are backfilled
with message history. Validate and deploy all shared API roles before testing the new UI live.

## Validation And Delivery

The bounded exact-photo recovery and UI ownership plan is documented in
[Exact Photo Duplicate Repair](exact-photo-duplicate-repair.md).

Run the impact planner, API/contracts/Prisma/miniapp/admin checks and infra checks. Run the
`message-duplicate`, `photo-duplicate-history.redis` and `rule-engine-media-cooldown.redis` specs
with `MAXIM_TEST_REDIS_URL` pointing only to disposable local Redis. The blocking API CI lane
runs all three patterns. The interval audit and rollout semantics are documented in
[Duplicate And Interval Audit](../incidents/2026-09-16-duplicate-interval-audit.md).
Verify the settings screen on mobile, including OFF, OBSERVE, DELETE_ONLY and FULL status.
Deploy the exact green SHA to every shared API role and the affected static components.

The `message-duplicates` BullMQ worker runs in `api-moderation-background`, concurrency two.
Jobs carry durable receipt references, not message text or media URLs. First media candidates
do not download; potential repeats trigger bounded verification. Ordering/source/pressure
deferrals expire after ten minutes. Failed source handling must retry rather than acknowledge
unfinished history work. Monitor queue backlog and failures through the read-only monitor.
Unavailable ordering registration retries before job submission. Ambiguous queue-add recovery
preserves incoming eligibility through the absorbing Redis permit; infrastructure failure alone
must not become a permanent prohibition. Unsupported downloaded binary formats are terminal
evidence failures, so one unsupported baseline cannot block subsequent verifiable candidates.
See [Duplicate Miss Audit](../incidents/2026-09-19-duplicate-miss-audit.md) for regression coverage
and the limits of attributing a reported miss.

Fingerprint admission stays capped at 16, with representation for every enabled kind and stable
value selection under truncation. Media comparison materializes all distinct candidate receipts
before recording the current occurrence. One attempt admits at most 20 uncached media items under
the existing 30-second verification deadline; additional work defers with revision-scoped proof
reuse and the same ten-minute job lifetime. Terminal baseline rejection is cached separately and
never acts as equality evidence. See [Reliability Plan](../../duplicate-reliability-plan-2026-09-20.md).

Job v2 has an absolute deadline capped at ten minutes from its trusted event timestamp, runtime
expiry and the current daily period. Re-add and cosmetic edits never extend the same occurrence's
action lifetime. Per-job permits remain readable after ordering completion and expire physically
after seven days; that retention does not extend authority. A retry with a missing permit stays
ineligible. Early suppression commits an immutable SQL revocation under its own nullable claim key
before mirroring it to Redis, without creating an ordering head or taking another rule's action claim.
The existing indexed claims retention exceeds the bounded action lifetime.

The first media admission has its own immutable SQL dedupe record with a nullable action key.
Webhook replay remains a retry even after both BullMQ and Redis state disappear. Only the first
admission may create a positive permit. A crash before its Redis registration leaves enforcement
unverified; later retries cannot manufacture authority. Concurrent admission briefly defers while
the first registration is incomplete. Neither admission nor revocation takes a competing rule's claim.
That brief wait applies only while the incoming action deadline is still open. An already-expired
replay reaches the existing Redis terminal settlement immediately: it creates no media job, renews
no authority and does not fail the ordered webhook merely because its permit is correctly false.

An authorized action acquires the common SQL claim before reserving its immutable reaction stage.
A foreign owner consumes no stage. An interrupted own claim resumes the same stage; delivery
failures and later revocation do not blindly decrement a valid reservation. The final guard reads
the same SQL denial and Redis permit in `api-action` and before each sanction. Revocation completed
before the last mutation guard blocks the action; an already dispatched MAX request cannot be cancelled.

Terminal qualification rejection, worker expiry and exhausted attempts release only the exact unused
duplicate action key in a serializable transaction. An existing delete intent or moderation event
prevents release; foreign and newer owners are retained. The old unique dedupe tombstone remains and
the exact authorization events are revoked atomically, so another rule can claim the message while
the interrupted old duplicate owner cannot reacquire it. Temporary infrastructure failures preserve
the resumable owner. Cleanup never blindly decrements a reserved reaction stage.

`cleanupOnly` jobs reconcile ownership without analysis or actions. SQL failures retry every
30 seconds even after the final analysis attempt, until the original deadline plus 24 hours.
Completed cleanup preserves the positive permit of a materialized intent; terminated cleanup
revokes it. New preclaims also commit an immutable SQL cleanup obligation in the same transaction;
`api-action` reconciles its due index independently of BullMQ, Redis and feature switches. Intent
handoff removes the obligation atomically. A SQL outage delays this recovery until SQL is available.

Repeated worker stalls can terminalize a `cleanupOnly` job before its processor runs, without a
`worker.cleanup_exhausted` event. The SQL obligation covers this queue-loss case for preclaims made
by the new writer. Do not use `job.retry()` as cleanup recovery: BullMQ retains its deferred-failure
and stalled counters.

Historical preclaims without an obligation are outside this guarantee. The migration creates an
empty table and performs no backfill; the reconciler never scans legacy claims. A surviving worker
can still release an exact unused owner, and an unexpired matching resume through the new writer
can register its obligation. Otherwise the claim remains fail-closed until exact reviewed recovery
or normal retention. An empty cleanup sample does not prove there are no historical orphan claims.

The legacy SQL claim has identity and creation time, but no original absolute action deadline or
exact binding/authorization event timestamps; its hashed keys cannot recover them. Retained webhook
payloads may supply an event timestamp, but do not prove the immutable deadline clipped by runtime
control or the daily period. There is no dedicated bounded orphan-preclaim audit/repair CLI.
`moderation:repair-missed-deletes` requires moderation-event evidence and creates delete intents;
it is not an unused-claim cleanup tool. Historical repair needs a separate bounded read-only preview
with exact owner generation and surviving job/binding evidence, followed by reviewed transactional
checks for intents, events and DELETE receipts plus exact-event revocation. Missing proof must remain
unresolved: never infer a deadline from `createdAt`, clear claims in bulk, or replay moderation.

Governor pause honors its bounded recommended delay; slow pacing permits progress after one delay
per job. Followers wait for the head's next eligible time or bounded crash recovery. Expiry ends work
without treating incomplete proof as a match or successful action. Media retains byte/pixel/decode limits.

## Operational Diagnostics

The SQL cleanup reconciler retains its limit of 25 due obligations per 10-second tick. Its
`message_duplicate_cleanup_sample` log reuses that indexed selection: `sampledDue` is a lower
bound at selection time, `sampleLimitReached` means the sample reached 25, and `oldestDueAgeMs`
is the age of the oldest selected deadline. It never performs a total-depth count or another
scan. Logs appear while a due sample exists and once when it becomes empty; a failed read is
reported as unavailable, never zero. `released` counts released owners, while materialized or
locked duties can remain unreleased. Logs contain no owner/chat/message identifiers, and a
diagnostic failure cannot change cleanup or action authority.

API processes emit `message_duplicate_diagnostics` structured summaries with `schemaVersion: 2`,
`windowStartedAt`, `windowEndedAt`, fixed numeric `counters` and `phases`. Each phase has a count,
total/max duration and a histogram aligned with `phaseBucketUpperBoundsMs`. Policy, source,
media proof, history and enforcement timings use a monotonic clock and include failed attempts.
The following fixed phases narrow those aggregate timings; overlapping phases must not be summed:

- `download`: a photo or binary download attempt, including source rejection and failure.
- `decode_wait`: local fingerprint-slot acquisition, including capacity/deadline rejection.
- `native_roundtrip`: sandbox IPC, process startup, decoding and reply; it is not CPU decode time.
  `local_fingerprint` measures the local development fallback, including hashing.
- `ordering_acquire`: one ordering acquisition attempt up to entry into the execution callback,
  or its deferral/error. It excludes execution and durable waits between retries; `worker.age_*`
  remains the total age since enqueue, including all earlier deferrals.
- `qualification`: fresh duplicate qualification; `intent_handoff`: durable intent handoff.
- `delete_dispatch`: duplicate-owned DELETE transport call, including admission and final guards.
  `delete_receipt`: persistence/finalization after a successful response. Neither count proves a
  successful receipt; failures are timed too. These labels exclude unrelated moderation rules.
- `cleanup`: worker terminal-cleanup attempt, including wakeup/retry handling; `cleanup_sweep`:
  an active or failed bounded SQL cleanup sweep. Empty idle sweeps do not emit phase samples.

The native protocol carries no per-stage CPU timing; separating native CPU work from IPC/startup
requires a separately reviewed measurement change. Durable ordering wait across retries likewise
has no exact standalone timer without changing persisted state. Timings remain best-effort attempts.
Emission is at most once per
30 seconds while active, plus a final shutdown flush. Summaries have no message contents,
identifiers, URLs or free-form errors. They are best-effort
process-local attempt counts; retries and baseline verification are included, and a crash can
lose the unflushed interval. Absence of a log record is not proof of zero activity.

Use bounded service-log reads to inspect these summaries, especially in
`api-moderation-background` (media/ordering) and `api-action` (final delete guards).
`history.no_match_or_allowed` includes originals and explicitly permitted repeats;
`history.matched` is detection, not deletion. `enforcement.intent_handoff` is durable handoff,
not a MAX receipt, and `worker.completed` does not imply any action. `worker.age_*` describes age
since original enqueue including retries, not individual request latency. Guard counters separate
changed content/history/settings, immunity, manual release, policy rejection and unavailable
verification. `media.budget_deferred` distinguishes bounded resource deferral from a non-match.
Continue using persisted delete receipts and authenticated per-chat diagnostics for actual outcomes.
Per-chat observation outcomes are separately aggregated in four 15-minute Redis buckets under
`message-duplicate:diagnostics:v1:<chat-digest>:<bucket>`, with a two-hour TTL and fixed fields.
Each process buffers at most 256 buckets plus one bounded flush, and has at most four writes in
flight. Blocked writes retain their slots; moderation never waits for a telemetry write. Every
write has a Redis-time deadline. Overflow, failed writes and a restart may lose observations,
so the API explicitly reports `BEST_EFFORT` and `ATTEMPTS`, never unique-message totals.
`telemetry.buffer_limited` and `telemetry.unavailable` identify observed losses.
The reader performs exactly four point reads with a 250 ms deadline. Missing data produces
`NO_DATA` with null counts/coverage; failure or malformed data produces `UNAVAILABLE`. A real
zero percent requires recorded supported attempts with no completed comparison. Media enqueue
is not a completed comparison and is excluded from the coverage denominator; verified media
attempts and retries are counted at the worker boundary. First candidates, stale revisions,
deferrals and failed comparisons cannot inflate verified coverage. Comparison success does not
prove that an action was handed off or a message deleted. No telemetry is used as action authority.
`worker.cleanup_retry`, `worker.cleanup_completed` and `worker.cleanup_exhausted` describe the
separate ownership recovery, including no-op cleanup, and never count new moderation actions.

`media.url_malformed`, `media.url_protocol`, `media.url_credentials`, `media.url_port` and
`media.url_host` classify rejected download attempts using fixed labels. Initial and refreshed
attempts, worker retries and separate baseline/current proofs can contribute independently.
These process-local counters are best-effort attempts, not exact rejected-message totals; they
emit no URLs, credentials, tokens or host values. A photo source rejection can trigger one exact
MAX message lookup per verification attempt. The same photo/author/chat/message must be confirmed
and the refreshed URL passes the unchanged downloader policy; a second rejection is terminal.

`guard.current_lookup_unavailable` and `guard.original_lookup_unavailable` locate a failed exact
message read while preserving the aggregate `guard.unavailable` counter and retry behavior.
`guard.current_lookup_confirmed_absent` and `guard.original_lookup_confirmed_absent` count exact
lookup absence, including a structured HTTP 404 with a message-specific MAX error code. Bare
HTTP 404, chat errors, free-form text, transport errors and other statuses remain unknown and
cannot remove evidence. Confirmed original absence tombstones that original without inventing
a new publication time. Confirmed current absence alone cannot authorize sanctions: the exact
successful DELETE receipt and every existing binding/policy check remain required. These fixed
labels disclose no message, chat, user, source or error payload.

The closed dashboard reports the active `message-duplicates` queue rather than the retired photo
queue. Missing registration or an unreadable Redis counter fails that snapshot as unavailable;
it must not appear as an empty duplicate backlog. Lightweight readiness and operational governor
snapshots do not add auxiliary queue reads.

Use `./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh postgres-audit duplicate` for bounded, identifier-free SQL
diagnostics. Re-provision the reviewed audit role after synchronizing this catalog: Antiduplicate
requires exactly 17 column SELECT grants and never table SELECT on settings or delete intents.
The `duplicate_settings` schema-v2 report separates `saved_eligibility` (master switch, MESSAGE
comparison, scope and valid schedule) from `legacy_compatibility` (retired toggle/presets).
`image_eligible_count_lower_bound` describes only the capped settings sample; it does not prove
current DAILY admission, runtime permission or fresh bot capability. SQL reports those runtime
facts as unobserved. Pair it with a separately dated runtime-control `get` and authenticated
capability snapshot; the observations are not atomic. Preserve `sample_saturated`, `complete`
and lower-bound qualifiers when interpreting the report.

If the delete-intent diagnostic times out, use
`./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh postgres-audit duplicate --explain` after synchronizing the
reviewed catalog. This emits only plain JSON EXPLAIN for the fixed intent query, skips execution
of settings/events reports, and retains the audit-role checks and existing timeouts. Ten literal
status predicates let the planner use status-specific statistics; each ordered source returns at
most 65 candidates including the saturation sentinel, with at most 9 reasons per selected intent.
Inspect that each large status uses the ordered `moderation_delete_intents_retention_idx` scan
directly below its LIMIT. The local regression includes all competing intent indexes and skewed
status populations; a production timeout can still reflect host I/O and does not authorize a
larger timeout, an unbounded scan or a new index without evidence.

## Runtime Control

Run the built operator inside the exact released `api-admin` container through the normal VPS
wrapper. All writes are previews without `--apply`. Inspect `get`, review the explicit CHAT
target through normal managed discovery, then repeat the reviewed command with `--apply`.
Only the designated test chat is a default live smoke target. Preserve administrator immunity;
an administrator's messages cannot prove participant enforcement.

```sh
node apps/api/dist/apps/api/src/scripts/message-duplicate-runtime-control.js get
node apps/api/dist/apps/api/src/scripts/message-duplicate-runtime-control.js set --expected-revision 0 --chat-id=-123 --mode delete_only --ttl-hours 24
node apps/api/dist/apps/api/src/scripts/message-duplicate-runtime-control.js set --expected-revision 1 --all-enabled-chats --mode full --permanent
node apps/api/dist/apps/api/src/scripts/message-duplicate-runtime-control.js off --expected-revision 2
```

Replace example IDs/revisions with reviewed values. V2 accepts either a bounded lifetime of at
most 24 hours or explicit `--permanent`. Scope is either at most 1000 unique IDs or
`--all-enabled-chats`; global scope requires no fleet enumeration or settings writes. Per-chat
`antiDuplicateEnabled` remains mandatory. Every update, including permanent OFF, advances the
CAS revision. New revisions/settings use separate fingerprint groups, so shadow or
pre-activation history cannot retrospectively escalate sanctions. Status output omits chat IDs
and message contents. Do not change unrelated chat or photo settings.

## Administrator Diagnostics

The mini app displays the first deleted message number, not a zero-based allowance:
stored allowance 0 is message 2, allowance 1 is message 3. The preview uses the same numbering
for every configured reaction; existing saved thresholds are not migrated or reset.

Authenticated chat administrators can read `GET /v1/chats/:chatId/duplicate-diagnostics` and
request `POST /v1/chats/:chatId/duplicate-diagnostics/recheck`. GET uses existing capability
snapshots; POST refreshes this chat through the shared multi-bot planner and its backoff.
Neither endpoint sends messages, deletes content or changes chat policy. A stale/backoff-retained
snapshot cannot confirm a requested live recheck. Saved enablement, runtime mode and permission
proof are separate fields. OFF stops duplicate actions; OBSERVE records matches without acting.

History samples at most 20 recent intents per status from the existing chat/status/created-time
index, inspecting at most 9 reason rows per candidate. It returns at most five duplicate entries
created in the last 24 hours, without text, user/bot identities or free-form errors. Saturated
samples are explicitly incomplete; a query timeout is unavailable history, not zero attempts.
Only a persisted remote deletion receipt is labelled deleted; verified absence remains a separate
outcome. New entries also expose the original message ID, publication time and fixed repeat-allowed
time, selected only from these bounded reason rows. Historical entries can lack this evidence.
The read query has a two-second statement deadline and a three-second transaction limit.

## Stop And Rollback

Use `off --expected-revision <current>`, preview then apply. Final dispatch rechecks control,
settings, author immunity, current MAX contents and read-only history; a queued intent is not
permanent authority. Full sanctions recheck inside the existing participant sanction lock and
before the actual WARN/MUTE/BAN mutation, with terminal event/ledger idempotency. Absence alone
is not authority: a removed message requires this exact successfully dispatched delete intent
and its matching content/revision binding. `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_ENABLED=false` is an additional
environment ceiling.

Both API rollback paths require v3 binding, lifecycle and durable/permit authorization source
capabilities and the Unicode near matcher with the `text-fixed-window-unicode-near-v6`
settings fence. The fence invalidates old STRICT and CUSTOM-with-near history, queued
jobs and grants; exact-only and IMAGE settings retain their prior evidence versions.
Use the shared API queue fence to stop old producers/workers and recreate every API role
before resuming processing. A mixed old/new fleet is not a supported activation state.
Never roll back to the old Latin/Cyrillic-only near matcher, even with control currently off:
the stored enabled settings and old grants must not regain authority on a later activation.
Pending intents
can survive a control downgrade, so an older unguarded API is not a valid rollback target.
Use a retained compatible immutable release and the normal queue-fenced rollback workflow.
Older images do not understand the new protocol and are rejected as targets; rollback does not downgrade
full sanctions into unguarded deletes. Inspect runtime status after rollback before re-enabling.
Never remove the shared message action claims or reset counters to replay moderation.
