# Storage and bot cost rollout

The initial runtime stages reduce delete-lease writes, bound the local chat-context
cache and skip exact repeated VK import observations. They add fixed runtime counters,
trusted-main CI layer reuse, unchanged settings/rollup write guards and sequential
binary Publication media preparation. Historical body/media expiry, receipt deletion,
database rewrites and notice-upload token reuse remain gated. See the
[full plan](../storage-and-bot-cost-optimization-plan-2026-10-01.md).

## Release and observation

Run the scoped checks and require green `Required` and `Analyze JavaScript and
TypeScript` CI checks for the exact source SHA. Deploy through the normal wrapper;
any API role selection expands to all 14 shared-image roles, including Publisher
and message retention. The queue ownership/pause fence, immutable image identity,
OCR sandbox attestation and strict smokes remain mandatory. Do not recreate
PostgreSQL or Redis. If local build capacity is insufficient, use the existing
verified exact-SHA CI image preload; retain the 10 GiB API build floor and 6 GiB
static floor. Required online multibot preparation has its own supervised 10 GiB
filesystem reserve; advisory peak estimates do not replace its live checks.

```bash
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh deploy main --plan
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh deploy main api-admin
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh postgres-audit storage
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh exec df -B1 / /mnt/maxim-cold
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh exec docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml exec -T api-admin node apps/api/dist/apps/api/src/scripts/audit-storage-runtime.js
```

The built `audit-storage-runtime` CLI requires the existing admin role and accepts
no arguments. It reads only the fixed Redis metric keys, starts no Nest workers,
makes no MAX or PostgreSQL calls, and prints allowlisted scalar JSON. The closed
system-admin endpoint is `GET /api/v1/system/metrics/storage-runtime`. Reports
publish every 30 seconds and expire after 90 seconds; collect after the first
publication. Missing, malformed, stale or unavailable reports are missing
coverage, not zero work. Reporting failure must not block bot work.

Keep saved snapshots owner-private. Retain only fixed service names, epochs,
numeric metrics and fixed readiness/condition enums. Full ready responses and
monitor logs may contain identifiers; archive only their allowlisted readiness,
numeric queue lag and fixed state. Do not save env, tokens, message/media payloads,
free-form errors, SQL, chat/user/bot IDs or arbitrary labels. The existing
`monitor-readonly` capacity archive already performs its own stricter sanitization.

Compare runtime counters separately for each service with the same `startedAt`;
any counter decrease invalidates that counter's interval. PostgreSQL restart,
database-statistics reset and WAL-statistics reset have independent boundaries.
Report gaps explicitly and normalize work by comparable traffic. Require at
least one day of comparable coverage before extrapolating capacity or savings;
queue-lag percentiles are not API/action response latency. Cache bytes estimate
retained data, not RSS. VK rows-written counters describe statement activity,
not committed transactions; skipped rows also include publication fences.
Table totals already include indexes and TOAST: never add them twice.

The later additive `deleteReconciler` report preserves old reports that lack the
field. Its fixed phase calls, results, error counts and monotonic duration buckets
do not change the one-second recovery cadence or hourly cleanup cadence. A
successful phase's `returnedCount` describes that method's returned scalar; it
is not an idle/pending/committed-work measurement. See the
[consumer and metric semantics matrix](../storage-body-lifecycle-consumer-matrix-2026-10-01.md).

Delete recovery selects an ordered prefix separately for each of its five fixed active
statuses, using the existing `(status, next_attempt_at, execute_at)` index. It then orders
at most five batch prefixes by the original due/creation keys and retains the original
total batch limit. This avoids a whole-population sort before a mixed-status LIMIT.
Each prefix retains all due, rollout, retry-evidence and retention predicates; only the
in-progress prefix requires an expired lease. `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` remains inside
each prefix, with at most five batch prefixes locked for the statement's lifetime.
Selection does not claim an execution lease or authorize an external retry.

The sweep's reason `EXISTS` probes retain their intent correlation with `OFFSET 0`.
Without that planner boundary, PostgreSQL can build hashed subplans by scanning the
whole reason inventory repeatedly for each status prefix, even when very few intents
are selected. The predicates and retry-cap evidence checks are unchanged. The real
PostgreSQL fixture checks reason-row visits as well as intent-row visits, with optional
rollout scopes both enabled and disabled; one bounded outer LIMIT alone is insufficient.

This is not a physical scan cap: rejecting eligibility predicates, equal due-time groups
or locked rows can require more index visits. The disposable PostgreSQL regression
compares a 50,000-row mixed-status population, verifies ordered results and concurrent
lock skipping, and checks that selection does not traverse the full eligible fixture.
Use the existing per-stage runtime duration counters to assess the live effect; do not
infer recovery from a single plan or Redis handoff acknowledgement.

The follow-up settings write guard compares JSONB values without depending on
property order, preserves raw-value repair and the existing `updatedAt` CAS, and
omits only unchanged media from the UPDATE. The forward-only rollup migration
preserves legacy arrays, feed/counters and transaction timestamps. It shortcuts
only physically small canonical empty/singleton arrays and exact unchanged
hour timestamps; larger or malformed arrays use the original DISTINCT cleanup.
Neither change rewrites historical rows or promises filesystem reclaim.

Canonical Publication execution selects only metadata for the exact content
revision and author before preparation. It then selects immutable bytes for one
asset at a time under the same revision, author, digest and size predicates, and
passes a Buffer view through the existing byte validator and upload protocol.
Image order, filename normalization, per-bot occurrence cache, progress heartbeat,
retries and pre-send ownership fences stay in place. Media-only posts still use
the normal message builder. Tagged remote video for the exact bot selects no local
bytes; the local video cap remains 24 MB and the scheduled image cap remains
6,000,000 bytes. Public/legacy DTO loaders still support base64. This removes an
internal conversion and multi-image byte preloading; it does not prove a particular
RSS reduction or impose a new admission/defer protocol.

## Release-image reclaim

For a separately reviewed maintenance preview, use the same deploy lock and the
manifest-aware tool with the five-release floor explicitly set. The production
CLI also defaults to five distinct release IDs and refuses a lower value:

```bash
./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh exec bash -c '
set -euo pipefail
source infra/scripts/lib/deploy-lock.sh
acquire_deploy_lock
node infra/scripts/release-image-reclaim.mjs reclaim \
  --state-dir /var/lib/maxim-deploy --until 168h \
  --minimum-retained-releases 5 --dry-run
'
```

Review the candidates, then repeat that same locked invocation with only
`--dry-run` removed for apply. The tool rechecks current/retained manifests and
all container references immediately before deletion. It removes only unused
old immutable MAXIM image refs. It preserves all retained releases, containers,
volumes, shared build cache and sibling-project images. Displayed image sizes
do not predict physically reclaimed bytes; compare `df -B1 /var/lib/docker`
before and after.

An optional normal-deploy hook uses that fixed seven-day cutoff and minimum five
distinct retained release IDs:

```bash
MAXIM_DEPLOY_RECLAIM_OLD_IMAGES=1 ./infra/scripts/vps-connect.sh deploy main api-admin
```

It is off by default, runs under the held deploy lock only after a newly committed
successful release and all strict smokes, and reports filesystem bytes. A reclaim
warning leaves the successful release valid; inspect it and rerun preview before
retrying cleanup. Do not retry a deployment solely because optional reclaim failed.

Global release count alone does not provide distinct component versions: static-only
releases can repeatedly inherit the same API image. Manifest pruning additionally
preserves representatives of two known distinct image IDs for each active component.
When that history is missing, it preserves all available manifests; reclaim preview
reports the gap and apply refuses cleanup. This is image availability, not schema
compatibility. An API rollback still requires the selected API source to contain the
live applied migrations and pass every existing source-floor and runtime guard.
In particular, an image predating a newly applied migration is not automatically a
valid rollback target. Artifact expiry also limits recovery: the one-day CI artifact
is not a permanent off-host backup of older releases.

## Gates for later stages

Historical UPDATE/DELETE/DROP, retention activation and physical rewrites require
a fresh encrypted full backup, verified checksum, complete isolated PostgreSQL 16
restore, replay/receipt safety checks and sufficient maintenance capacity. The
[watched backup](watched-postgres-backup.md) is attended and readiness/queue/space
gated; an archive list is not restore proof. Budget a restore outside the production
root filesystem and leave existing verified backups until the new chain passes.
A logical restore measures compact restored size; it does not measure production
bloat. Deletion/ordinary VACUUM does not guarantee filesystem space recovery.

Deferred notice-upload reuse requires both the current send-owner fence and the
exact bot plus immutable asset identity (content digest/version). Invalidate only
the exact rejected token with CAS after a definitive documented media-token 4xx
rejection, then reacquire the upload lease; a concurrent newer token must survive.
Do not reuse tokens across bots or retry an ambiguous send/timeout/5xx as a token
failure. Other 4xx statuses do not automatically authorize reupload. These
requirements describe a future change; this rollout does not activate that cache.
