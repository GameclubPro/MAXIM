# Safe refactoring boundaries

The program preserves public API responses, callback payloads, queue envelopes, stored jobs,
authorization and the order of side effects. Each runtime slice has its own reviewed commit,
exact-SHA CI, scoped deployment and rollback-compatible observation window.

## Starting evidence

The API/UI baseline is `e4c960ad46369a68409b656efe7632f62adeec18`. Both required GitHub
checks passed. A fresh worktree installed the lockfile with Node 24.16.0 and ran
`node scripts/agent/with-test-stores.mjs --migrate -- npm run check` successfully.
The API reported 695 passing suites and 14,965 passing tests, with one skipped suite/test.
The mini app reported 1,451 passing tests and Safety Desk 21. Tooling's two opt-in skips
and the API skip are not claimed as test coverage. Production dependency audit reported
zero advisories. No original-worktree changes were copied into this baseline.

The production-origin mini app build measured these route budgets (gzip KiB, rounded):

| Route                      | JavaScript |  CSS |
| -------------------------- | ---------: | ---: |
| Startup                    |      123.7 | 33.5 |
| Chat settings, incremental |      142.8 | 71.5 |
| Publications, incremental  |      139.4 | 17.3 |

Rebuild with the same `VITE_API_BASE`, lockfile and budget definitions for comparisons.
Queue-lag samples are not HTTP latency measurements.

## Implemented boundaries

- `check:refactor-guards` also checks runtime context factories and legacy compatibility
  ports. The initial 16 exceptions pin existing definitions. Changed unsafe bridges fail;
  removed bridges require their exception to disappear. Never regenerate a growing baseline.
- Private settings search, summaries and buttons are pure functions. Their rendering corpus
  was captured from the baseline before extraction and passed against that implementation.
  Formatting is separate from Nest-dependent input parsing. The private facade retains
  callback/session orchestration and uses the same pure callback payload builder.

## Remaining release slices

1. Replace administrative runtime contexts domain by domain with explicit capabilities and
   preserve live getter identity, method receivers and initialization order.
2. Extract required-subscription state, settings draft/save ownership and rules editor state.
3. Separate publication browsing/calendar from editor lifecycle without changing request identity.
4. Extract night/manual-close message handling while retaining durable intent and claim ordering.
5. Measure independent optimization candidates after their structural release is stable.

For each slice, add missing behavior/race tests before moving the boundary; shrink the legacy
guard and relevant context exceptions afterwards. Real-store cases run through the public
validation wrappers. Browser scenarios exercise user actions and request results in addition
to architectural source checks. Retain current release source floors and observe strict
smokes plus at least 30 minutes of runtime health before the next production slice.

## Allowlist and rules dependency boundary

The allowlist and rule-text runtimes now accept explicit capabilities. Their composition in
`AdminService` preserves lazy access to constructor-owned clients, cache identity and method
receivers. Rules no longer expose arbitrary property reads/writes or require `as any` calls;
obsolete forwarding methods and copied unused imports have been removed. The unsafe-context
baseline shrinks from 16 to 14 exceptions. No new cache or persistence format is introduced.

Before changing the boundary, 37 focused tests passed on the old implementation, including
new denial/no-I/O and transaction/audit/cache ordering cases. Runtime tests construct these
components independently of `AdminService`. Release verification remains per PR.

## Participants and statistics state ownership

Participant pages, channel statistics and activity dashboards own their response maps and
pending refreshes inside their runtimes. The assembly supplies typed authorization, profile,
client and cross-domain feed capabilities. Participant details reuse the same runtime as
participant lists; no caller constructs a fresh runtime from a legacy object. Pure date,
number, profile and participant-query helpers no longer call back into `AdminService`.
The unsafe-context baseline shrinks from 14 to 11 exceptions. Cache keys, TTLs, authorization
on cache hits and identity checks before failed-promise eviction are preserved.

Before extraction, the focused service/runtime suite passed 465 tests. Existing behavioral
cases remain; obsolete context-forwarding tests now cover only the remaining capabilities.
Additional independent channel-statistics cases exercise concurrent reads, revoked cached
access, late failure after invalidation, per-channel invalidation and refresh coalescing.

## Managed entities access and snapshot ownership

Discovery snapshots and coalesced allowlist reads now have one owner with two explicit
capabilities: runtime-scope filtering and the existing uncached loader. User/type keys,
TTL boundaries, clone behavior, first-entity-wins ordering, actor-wide invalidation and
late-rejection identity checks remain unchanged. Access denial mutations live with access
pruning and retain the exact Major bot scope. Refresh presentation is a standalone function.
The managed-entities facade port declares independent signatures; unsafe-context exceptions
shrink from 11 to 8. Full discovery orchestration and SQL query policy remain unchanged.

Before transfer, 84 focused tests passed, including seven new snapshot/cache cases. After
transfer, 506 focused tests passed across service, access, discovery and snapshot boundaries.
Independent access-runtime tests cover bot-scope isolation, live capability replacement,
blank identity and best-effort persistence failure. Release verification remains per PR.

## Manual actions and required-subscription capabilities

Manual moderation and required-subscription runtimes now receive explicit capabilities.
Manual notice identity, persisted-result interpretation, error classification and summaries
use independent functions. The group-mute follow-up calls its own runtime directly rather
than round-tripping through a legacy forwarding method. The existing external lease boundary
is unchanged. Delivery-bot capabilities explicitly describe their existing null/undefined
fallback, and ledger views describe the metadata already returned by persistence.

Required-subscription headers reuse the existing equivalent header builder. Catalog merging
accepts an explicit bot-normalization capability and preserves row order, bot scope and
metadata precedence. Neither domain adds a cache or changes queue/ledger/persistence formats.
Unsafe-context exceptions shrink from 8 to 6. The focused suite passed 468 tests; independent
manual-notice cases additionally verify claim/attempt/send/receipt order, duplicate claims,
lost MAX replies and failed receipt commits. Existing independent subscription epoch/race
cases remain active. Full release validation is required for this slice.

## Broadcast and suggestion delivery capability boundary

Broadcast and suggestion-delivery runtimes receive explicit lazy capabilities. Broadcast
throttle timestamps now belong to each runtime; governor and system-mode warnings retain
one shared 60-second suppression interval within that runtime. Suggestion recovery retains
the existing job identifier, eight attempts, exponential backoff and failed/completed-job
retry behavior.

Broadcast button construction has a separate typed dependency boundary. Chat/channel row
ordering, comments/suggestion flags, bot scope and copied persisted button rows are checked
without constructing `AdminService`. The legacy test facade no longer forwards four private
broadcast methods through `any`; existing occurrence and reconciliation scenarios invoke
the owning runtime. Unsafe-context exceptions decrease from six to four. Persisted
publication, delivery, callback and queue formats remain unchanged.

## Dialog and suggestion capability boundary

The remaining dialog mapping, suggestion image and suggestion publication contexts now use
explicit dependencies. Parsing, attachment classification, reactions and stored actor
identity are pure functions; generic value readers are shared without importing the manual
moderation runtime. The dialog facade declares independent signatures using the existing
contract types. All 16 original unsafe-context exceptions have now been removed.

An 89-case corpus captured from the compiled legacy class protects normal and malformed
payload interpretation. Independent tests cover viewer/admin permissions and required
versus legacy image storage. Existing suggestion publication scenarios retain crash,
ambiguous-send and bot-scope coverage. Explicit composition exposed two previously hidden
type mismatches: review synchronization returns a count, and published suggestion text is
always HTML or Markdown. Types now express those existing results; the unreachable plain
fallback is removed without changing generated content or ledger digests.

## Required-subscription UI ownership

The required-subscription controller owns source lookup, refresh state, locally resolved
headers and source-selection actions. The page retains the settings draft; functional
updates preserve unrelated edits. Lookup replies carry chat, generation, request and input
identity, so navigation, unmount and subsequent input invalidate stale effects. Failed
lookup and a full selection reached during lookup preserve the entered link. Server
refreshes no longer discard metadata for unsaved external sources.

The browser suite runs against the extracted controller and real source-input component,
asserting request bodies, delayed success/error, navigation, duplicate clicks, concurrent
draft edits, selection limits and error retention. It also opens the actual settings route
on iPhone/Android in light/dark themes. CI runs this suite in the existing Mini App lane.
Existing mini app tests and production gzip/CSS budgets remain required.

## Settings draft and section-save ownership

`useSettingsDraft` owns the settings draft, hydration baseline, field errors, permission
retry and section conflict state. Section saves retain the source chat and a per-visit
identity, including navigation away and back to the same chat. Cache updates remain scoped
to that source; UI effects require the current visit. The draft present at submission is
kept separately from the normalized request payload, preserving edits made during a save
without discarding prepared stop-word inputs. Saved stop-word buffers clear only if unchanged.

The existing section merge and revision rules, stop-word endpoint and permission rollback
remain in use. Conflict presentation retains the latest draft, including edits made while
waiting. Browser cases cover real PATCH bodies, network failures, version conflicts,
background refresh, late replies, a repeated visit and navigation during conflict refresh.
The existing leave guard receives a setter bound to its originating visit. Speech-style
completion uses the same scoped synchronization. No layout or contract format changes.

## Rules editor ownership

`useSettingsRules` owns the rules draft, validation, image-preparation gate, hydration baseline,
autosave timer, publication mode and reset confirmation. It reuses the existing serialization,
button validation, automatic text generation and save-before-publish comparison. Each network
operation carries its originating visit and chat; stale completion updates/invalidate only
that chat's cache and cannot publish after navigation or show messages on another screen.
Image callbacks and the workspace leave guard use the same scoped draft setter.

Independent browser scenarios cover PUT payloads, edits during autosave, failed-save retry
suppression, navigation between save and publication, late publication results, duplicate
clicks and missing publication links. The real settings route also exercises native image
selection, decoder failure/cancellation, editor closing, save/publish gating, keyboard focus
and native Back across iPhone/Android light/dark and a desktop viewport. These browser suites
run in the existing CI lane; no production chat is used for test publication.

## Publication feed and calendar boundaries

The publication list controller owns URL filters, search debounce, cursor queries, legacy
list presentation and list navigation. Calendar availability has its own target scope,
publication exclusion and daily range refresh. Query keys, limits, polling intervals,
cursor merging and enablement conditions are unchanged; the editor still uses the existing
composer and request identities. A page-size guard prevents the extracted responsibilities
from returning to the page.

Browser scenarios assert server cursors, explicit load-more, filter-specific pagination,
late-query isolation, query suspension while editing, calendar target/exclusion payloads
and filters after editor return. Existing profile-separation and video-upload scenarios
remain required; the new list suite is included in CI.

## Publication action boundaries

The action controller owns cancel/pause/resume, retry-version selection, ambiguous delivery
confirmation and their pending targets. It receives the existing page request-identity owner;
identities survive errors and are cleared only after success, independently per action slot.
Revision conflicts retain the original refresh and feedback behavior. Confirmation sheets
preserve their ordering around publication details, pending guards and native Back handling.
Browser checks exercise actual payloads, duplicate-click prevention, retries after a lost
response, revision conflicts and original/latest content selection through the real API client.
