# Agent Machine Interface

Use direct Node entrypoints so npm's own banner does not precede JSON:

```bash
node scripts/agent/context.mjs --path scripts/agent/verify.mjs --json
node scripts/agent/plan.mjs --since HEAD --json
node scripts/agent/verify.mjs --since HEAD --dry-run --json
node scripts/agent/focused.mjs --test scripts/agent/test/verify-cli.test.mjs --json
```

`plan` and `verify` retain worktree, staged and committed-range selection. `--since <ref>`
selects the union of committed changes from the resolved baseline to HEAD and current staged,
unstaged and untracked changes. Paths and selections are deduplicated; both sides of rename chains
remain in scope. Its `source.base` and `source.head` are resolved commit SHAs. Presence of a changed
migration follows the current worktree, and schema review compares baseline with worktree. This
scope cannot be combined with explicit worktree/staged/range modes or `verify --full`.

## Verification JSON v1

`verify --json` and `--format json` emit one final JSON document on stdout, including failures.
Preflight and child stdout/stderr go to stderr. Exit 0 means planned or passed; exit 2 means failed.
Interrupted processes may leave no result: absence of a document or terminal status is not success.
The default human interface used by the commit helper remains available.

| Field                                               | Contract                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schemaVersion`, `repo`                             | `1`, `major`.                                                                                                                       |
| `root`, `head`                                      | Absolute Git root and current checkout HEAD; null if resolution failed. Range target refs are separately recorded in `plan.source`. |
| `mode`, `dryRun`                                    | `worktree`, `staged`, `range`, `since` or `full`; mode may be null for invalid arguments.                                           |
| `status`                                            | `planned`, `passed` or `failed`. Planning never establishes validation.                                                             |
| `plan`                                              | Unmodified impact-plan v1, or null for full mode / failure before planning.                                                         |
| `commands`                                          | Ordered selection from `selectVerificationScripts`, after existing aggregate deduplication.                                         |
| `snapshotTree`                                      | Staged tree guarded during this run, otherwise null. This is not a reusable QA attestation.                                         |
| `error`                                             | Null or `{stage, code, message, commandId}`. Migration refusal uses `MIGRATION_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.                                    |
| `requiresSubmissionAggregate`, `requiresExactShaCi` | Both true, even after successful local execution.                                                                                   |

Each command contains `id`, `kind`, `executable`, `args`, `cwd`, `resources`, `status`, `exitCode`
and `signal`. `args` is an argument array, never a shell string. `resources: ["checkout"]` is a
coarse scheduling hint keyed by `cwd`; public generator and deployment locks still own admission.
Command status is `planned`, `not-run`, `passed` or `failed`; exit/signal are null before execution.
A command may pass while overall verification fails its subsequent staged snapshot check.

Dry-run checks script mappings and migration requirements but starts neither preflight nor tests.
An execution runs public npm scripts sequentially and preserves the existing staged guards.
These outputs introduce no verification cache and do not replace the commit helper, exact-SHA CI,
guarded deployment, component manifests or production acceptance.

## Focused Checks Before Submission

`focused.mjs` requires repeatable `--test <existing-repository-relative-file>` arguments, with
optional `--repo`, `--dry-run`, `--json` / `--format`. It returns the same result envelope with
`mode: "focused"`, `plan: null`, selected `tests` and grouped commands. Unknown families, missing
files, traversal and links outside the repository fail closed; they never trigger full verification.

| Test family                                                                                                     | Owned execution route                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Root `scripts/*.test.mjs`, `scripts/agent/test/*.test.mjs`, `scripts/ci/*.test.mjs`, `infra/scripts/*.test.mjs` | Node test runner with exact paths.                                                                        |
| `apps/miniapp/test/*.test.ts`, `apps/admin/test/*.test.ts`                                                      | Local workspace tsx through offline npm exec; refuses if the declared runner contract changes.            |
| `apps/api/src/**/*.spec.ts`, `apps/api/test/**/*.spec.ts`                                                       | Public API npm test, retaining codegen and locks; forwards exact Jest paths through all three npm layers. |

Contracts cases under `packages/contracts/test/*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts` use the public contracts
npm test, retaining its locked build and forwarding selected Vitest paths.

Focused checks are not the final aggregate. The commit helper owns final staged verification;
do not run `verify`'s same aggregate in advance merely to populate coordinator status. Native cases
still require the public [test-store wrapper](agent-local-environment.md) and explicit evidence of
the required storage coverage; a runner exit code alone does not establish native coverage.

Focused native selection reports `requiresTestStores: true`, command resources `postgres`/`redis`
and required environment names without values. It uses literal membership of the maintained API
native lane and parsed reads of canonical store environment variables in the selected source;
comments and string examples do not classify a test as native. Execution requires consistent
aliases and the existing local race-environment guard before starting tests. Run such selections
inside `with-test-stores.mjs --migrate --`; this interface never silently starts nested stores.

## Major ↔ Karavan Integration References

Select both repositories when a changed boundary requires it. Ordinary text/UI work stays within
the affected product. Major owns its DTO validation, exact MAX authority and command proxy;
Karavan owns marketplace data and application of commands. Keep the code map and acceptance profile
aligned with the [maintained integration runbook](../operations/runbooks/karavan-chat-marketplaces.md).

Karavan's matching handlers and release configuration remain documented in its own
`docs/chat-marketplaces-release.md`. Pair configuration checks do not prove protocol or runtime
compatibility; use the relevant consumer/provider cases and selected transitional version pair.
