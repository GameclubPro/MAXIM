# Project knowledge for the support assistant

The owner's request on 2026-10-29 is to answer questions about every project module.
The scope is customer support for administrators, with participant guidance for subscription,
giveaways and the support-room policy. Internal infrastructure, owner controls, credentials and
private account data are not customer instructions. Updating this knowledge does not train model
weights or give the assistant account tools.

## Coverage and sources

The maintained inventory is `moduleCoverage` in
[support-llm-knowledge.json](../../infra/scripts/support-llm-knowledge.json). Each family identifies
its facts, shared settings sections and a retrieval probe. Facts link the actual UI, contracts and,
where needed, the implementing service. `projectReview` describes the module review; per-fact
review fields identify newly checked instructions. Original MAX documentation retrieval dates
remain separate and must not be refreshed without fetching those pages again.

The automated inventory comparison covers every section in
[settings-workspace-sections.ts](../../apps/miniapp/src/pages/settings/settings-workspace-sections.ts).
Polls, giveaways, participant screens and Publisher routes live outside that shared registry and
need an explicit inventory entry when their public modules change. A family being listed does not
prove every possible question or every implementation field has been evaluated.

## Preserve the product distinctions

- A visible setting is not proof that its enforcement is available. Invitation access cannot
  currently be activated; image checks and pilot integrations retain their availability conditions.
- «Без сообщений» keeps a person in the chat while the bot deletes new messages for the selected
  duration. Command defaults and the participant-card duration are separate. When MAX requires
  manual unblocking, the application's check does not perform that unblock.
- Anonymous poll identities are hidden from administrators too. A poll has one current answer
  per voter; a new choice changes that answer. Published questions and options cannot be edited.
- A giveaway entry is separate from verified eligibility. Recording a prize as «Выдано» does not
  transfer money or deliver it. User-specific eligibility and winnings require the actual page.
- An unknown publication outcome never proves absence. Inspect the existing poll or Publisher
  post before recommending another send. Preserve independent tasks in a combined question.
- Network settings results, network audience coverage, moderation actions and join/leave events
  are separate views. Missing observations do not prove zero activity or successful actions.

## Updating and validating

Inspect the public screen, limits in contracts and relevant service before changing a fact.
Use exact visible action labels rather than mistaking an editor heading for a button. Keep facts
atomic; a module's full manual should not become every answer to that module.

Update semantic retrieval as well as keywords: existing primary facts suppress fallback keyword
retrieval. Topic inheritance must support short followups and stop at a completed task or ordinary
conversation. Preserve the concise Russian response contract and verified catalog link rendering.

[Project coverage tests](../../infra/scripts/support-llm-project-coverage.test.mjs) check module
retrieval, shared registry coverage, key product limits, followups and neighboring boundaries.
Run these with the existing routing, knowledge, client and answer-policy cases before the selected
aggregate checks. For model evaluation, seal new formulations before the run, retain first answers,
raw drafts, usage and errors privately, and review semantics against the source. Revised cases
and reruns are development evidence, not an independent evaluation.

No generated evaluation messages belong in MAX groups. After exact-source CI, refresh the guarded
host knowledge and immutable workstation bundle, then use the read-only pilot preview and one
fresh worker readback. Availability is separate from real user acceptance.
