# Local environment for MAXIM agents

Use the repository's Node 24 requirement and lockfile. Install dependencies with `npm ci` in the
checkout being tested; never replace another worktree's dependencies or copy a stale generated
Prisma client. Public API scripts own code generation and its lock.

## Check before expensive work

```bash
node scripts/agent/doctor.mjs --browser
node scripts/agent/preflight.mjs
node scripts/agent/plan.mjs --worktree
```

The doctor checks local tools, dependency presence and the matching Playwright Chromium binary.
`--browser` also launches an isolated headless page without network access. It does not inspect
credentials or change Codex settings. Dependency presence is not lockfile-integrity validation;
use `npm ci` after dependency changes. Docker availability is optional when native test stores work.

Required tools: Node 24/npm, Git, GitHub CLI, ripgrep, Python 3, ShellCheck, jq, PostgreSQL 16
server/client binaries and Redis 7 server/client. Keep `initdb`, `postgres`, `pg_isready`, `createdb`,
`psql`, `redis-server` and `redis-cli` on PATH. For workflow editing, install the actionlint version
pinned in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (currently 1.7.7). Compiler/build tools are needed only when
installing a dependency with native compilation. Do not update application dependencies merely
to prepare an agent machine.

On Ubuntu 24.04, an administrator can install the native tools using the distribution packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-16 postgresql-client-16 redis-server redis-tools shellcheck jq ripgrep unzip
```

These packages may enable system services; the disposable runner below does not need them.
Without administrator access, download the same packages using APT with private state/cache
directories, verify package SHA-256 against the authenticated package index, and extract them
with `dpkg-deb -x` into a user-owned prefix. Include runtime libraries and wrap binaries with
that prefix's library path. Do not weaken repository-signature validation or overwrite existing
user wrappers. Record installed versions/checksums locally, outside Git. Refresh stale package
indexes on a download 404 instead of falling back silently to an older server.

Install the browser revision required by this checkout:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

If the browser launch reports missing OS libraries, use the supported Playwright dependency
installer with administrator access. Existing compatible system libraries need no reinstall.
Keep WSL projects, node_modules and temporary databases on the Linux filesystem for I/O efficiency.

## Disposable real-store validation without Docker

```bash
node scripts/agent/with-test-stores.mjs --migrate -- npm run test:postgres-races --workspace @maxim/api
node scripts/agent/with-test-stores.mjs --migrate -- npm run test:retention-storage --workspace @maxim/api
node scripts/agent/with-test-stores.mjs -- npm test --workspace @maxim/api -- publisher-access-refresh.redis
```

For a focused SQL regression, preserve the public API lock/codegen wrapper:

```bash
node scripts/agent/with-test-stores.mjs --migrate -- npm test --workspace @maxim/api -- moderation-delete-due-postgres.spec.ts
```

The runner requires a non-root Linux/macOS shell (WSL is supported). Each invocation creates a
private directory, randomly named `race_test` database, fresh PostgreSQL credentials and independent loopback
ports. PostgreSQL server and clients use UTC. Redis matches CI's host/port-only fixture contract,
with persistence disabled and its owned process verified through a private Unix socket. Inherited `DATABASE_URL`,
`REDIS_URL`, `CHAT_ROUTING_POSTGRES_RACE_DATABASE_URL`, `MAXIM_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` and
`MAXIM_TEST_REDIS_URL` are replaced only for child processes. URLs are not printed or written into
repository env files. `--migrate` uses the public Prisma deployment script against that empty local
database, then runs the same baseline-aware schema drift check as CI before starting the requested
command. A mismatch or failed comparison prevents that command from starting and still removes
the owned stores. The committed known-drift baseline is not changed by this check. It never
imports production data or starts application workers.

The command's exit status is preserved. On normal completion, command failure, SIGINT or SIGTERM,
the runner stops only its own process groups and removes its temporary stores. SIGKILL/host loss
cannot run cleanup; inspect exact process identity before manual recovery, never kill a stale PID
or reuse somebody else's database. Run expensive API validation sequentially through public scripts;
separate store ports do not remove the shared code-generation lock.

The runner's integration self-check is opt-in so normal tooling tests do not silently depend on
native binaries:

```bash
MAXIM_AGENT_TEST_STORES=1 node --test scripts/agent/test/test-stores.test.mjs
```

## Choosing the right evidence

For queue/SQL changes, test representative history, skew, nonmatching rows, retries, ordering and
locked rows on real stores. Assert bounded rows/probe loops and results; small mocks and `LIMIT`
alone do not prove bounded work. State store-dependent skips explicitly. A green local suite does
not replace exact-source/main CI, guarded deployment or full production acceptance.

Use the smallest relevant validation while editing, then run the impact plan. Docs and agent-tooling
changes do not need a VPS runtime deploy. Keep incident details in the dated incident record;
AGENTS notes hold stable commands and invariants, not current PIDs, release IDs or unproven causes.
